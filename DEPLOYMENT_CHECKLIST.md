  - [ ] `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- [ ] Push a test commit to a feature branch
- [ ] Verify test workflow runs on PR

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** (Actions tab)
2. **SSH into VPS** and check:
   ```bash
   # Check Laravel logs
   tail -f ~/labortrack/shared/storage/logs/laravel.log
   
   # Check web server logs
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   
   # Check PHP-FPM
   sudo systemctl status php8.4-fpm
   
   # Manual deployment test
   cd ~/labortrack
   bash -x deploy.sh  # -x for debug output
   ```
3. **Verify permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/labortrack/current
   ls -la ~/labortrack/shared/storage
   ```
4. **Check .env file**: `cat ~/labortrack/shared/.env`
5. **Review DEPLOYMENT.md** for detailed troubleshooting

**Once all items are checked, your CI/CD pipeline is complete! üéâ**

Every push to `main` will now automatically deploy to your VPS with zero downtime.
